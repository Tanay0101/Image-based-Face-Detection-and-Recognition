# Image-based-Face-Detection-and-Recognition
The goal is to make an application for face recognition and detection. We are using LFW dataset to train our model. Our model uses pretrained inception network to generate embeddings and MTCNN for face extraction. We are getting 95% accuracy on the dataset.

The face extraction file extracts faces from the dataset this may take around 1 hour but is a one time process. The utils function loads the data.
